# Bluetooth Scanner with Swift UI

Example blescanner using SwiftUI with a Whoop heart rate monitor

Uses:
- Core Bluetooth for BLE connection
- Combine for state management 

Aim was to reverse engineer a whoop band (https://www.whoop.com/)[https://www.whoop.com/], then build a SwiftUI that updated on each new reading of the heart rate from the band.

# Overview

Very Simple UI that updates based off heart rate update from the Whoop device

# Whoop instructions

Can be found in /blescanner/Views/Device/DeviceViewModel.swift
